# Image-Gallery
I 🚀 Just built an enhanced Responsive Image Gallery using #HTML, #CSS, and #JavaScript!

This project features:

Smart Masonry Layout: CSS Grid with dynamic row spans for gap-free, Pinterest-style arrangement based on image aspect ratios.
One-Click Upload: Multiple image uploads via FileReader API, instantly adding to the gallery with data URLs.
Category Filters: Updated to 'All', 'Albums', 'Camera Uploads', 'Documents' for better organization.
Mobile-First Design: Responsive grid that adapts from single column on mobile to multi-column on larger screens.
Fullscreen Lightbox: Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Esc), image filters (grayscale, blur, sepia), and smooth transitions.
Accessibility: Focus management, ARIA attributes, and keyboard support for inclusive UX.
Key tech highlights:

HTML: Semantic structure with hidden file input and dynamic elements.
CSS: Grid masonry, backdrop-filter for overlays, media queries for responsiveness.
JS: Event handling for uploads, filters, lightbox, and dynamic card building with aspect ratio calculations.
Perfect for showcasing web dev skills! Check it out and let me know your thoughts. #WebDevelopment #Frontend #JavaScript #CSSGrid #ResponsiveDesign
